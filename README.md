# My-Personal-Website

## Summary

I used HTML5, TailWindCSS, JavaScript to code the website and I used SvelteKit as a framework. This was my first time coding and making a front end project. It was also my first time deploying a project.
Hopefully you like the results you can check out my website here, https://loboswebsite.vercel.app/.
